🚦 Accident Hotspot and Risk Factor Analysis  (Task-4)

 Project Description:
This project involves the exploration of a large-scale US road accident dataset with the objective of detecting accident hotspot regions and examining the major factors that contribute to road accidents. The analysis provides valuable insights into locations and conditions where accidents are more likely to occur.

Technologies Used:
Python
Google Colab
Pandas and NumPy
Matplotlib and Seaborn
Folium

 Project Workflow:
Accessed and managed a large accident dataset using Google Drive integrated with Google Colab
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing for accurate analysis
Generated an interactive map to highlight accident hotspot locations using latitude and longitude data
Investigated important contributing factors such as weather conditions, visibility levels, and accident severity
Visualized trends and patterns using meaningful charts and plots

📂 Dataset Information:
US Accidents Dataset (March 2023)

Execution Steps:
Launch the notebook in Google Colab
Connect Google Drive and place the dataset in the appropriate directory
Execute each cell step by step to reproduce the analysis

Key Takeaways:
This project strengthened practical skills in working with large datasets, conducting exploratory data analysis, and applying geospatial visualization techniques to derive actionable insights from real-world data
